This repository consists of progamming code, workspaces, and a real dataset for the paper "Analysis of length-biased and partly interval-censored survival data with mismeasured covariates" written by Li-Pang Chen and Bangxu Qiu, which has been submitted for consideration for publication in Biometrics. 

A list of files:
1. tandmob2.RData: A dataset for the signal tandmobiel study.
2. SIMEXBoost_normal.R: An R script for simulation studies based on the proposed method with measurement error correction.
3. SIMEXBoost_normal.RData: A workspace that contains the estimation results from SIMEXBoost_normal.R.
4. Naive_normal.R: An R script for simulation studies based on the naive method ignores measurement error effects.
5. Naive_normal.RData: A workspace that contains the estimation results from Naive_normal.R.
6. k-fold SIMEXBoost for tooth data.R: An script for real data analysis (for the dataset "tandmob2.csv") based on the proposed method.
